# Darelover Ntfs-3g

## Overview

Since [osxfuse's new non free-license](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/616) is not compatible with Homebrew's guidelines, they decided to [deprecate](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/64491) and later, [disable](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/11075) the fuse formuale. So, this tap serves as the backup method to install ntfs-3g formula using brew.

## How do I install this formula?

Run: `brew install darelover/ntfs-3g/ntfs-3g`

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
